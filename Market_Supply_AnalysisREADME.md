 Conclusion

 

1. Seasonal Trends:
   - The bar chart effectively illustrates seasonal patterns, allowing easy comparison of prices across seasons and different vegetable types.
   - Certain vegetables, such as tomatoes and peas, perform well during the monsoon season, while brinjal, ginger, and okra thrive in the summer.
   - Prices for different vegetables tend to peak during late summer and early monsoon seasons.
   - Onions exhibit higher prices during autumn.

2. Sales Patterns:
   - Lidi stands out with the highest sales of $4865.25, followed by Schwarz with $4697.35.
   - Sales generally increase from the 5th to the 15th month but start decreasing from the 20th to the 30th month.
   - Target has the lowest sales among the observed vendors.

3. Supplier Relationships:
   - Positive correlation between two suppliers suggests that when one has high sales, the other tends to have high sales as well.
   - Negative correlation, as seen with Metro and Walmart, indicates that when one supplier has high sales, the other tends to have low sales.



These conclusions provide a starting point for deeper analysis and potentially inform strategic decisions for businesses involved in the sale of vegetables. Further analysis and predictive modeling can be undertaken to develop a more comprehensive understanding of the factors influencing vegetable sales.

Recommendations/Implications


   - Businesses may want to adjust their inventory and marketing strategies based on seasonal variations, focusing on the specific vegetables that perform well during certain seasons.
   - Pricing strategies should take into account the observed peaks in vegetable prices during late summer and early monsoon seasons.
   - The decline in sales during the later months could prompt further investigation into potential factors affecting customer behavior.
